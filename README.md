## Overview

Threading in programming refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. It is a
powerful technique that can significantly improve the efficiency and speed of a program by allowing multiple tasks to be
performed simultaneously. Unlike traditional single-threaded programs, where tasks are executed sequentially, threading
enables parallelism, which is particularly beneficial in tasks that involve heavy computation, I/O operations, or other
time-consuming processes. By dividing a program into smaller threads, each responsible for a specific subset of tasks,
developers can harness the full potential of multi-core processors and ensure that the CPU is utilized more effectively.
This results in faster execution times and improved overall performance. Threading is especially valuable in scenarios
where certain tasks can be performed independently, allowing the program to make progress on multiple fronts
concurrently. However, it's essential to manage thread synchronization and avoid potential race conditions to ensure the
integrity of shared data. In summary, threading is a valuable tool in programming that enhances the speed and
responsiveness of applications by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware.

## ENV VARS

Through the use of the dotenv module, we ensure
that these environment variables are seamlessly loaded into the application's runtime environment. This not only
bolsters security by isolating confidential information from the codebase but also facilitates effortless configuration
adjustments without modifying the source code directly. The integration of the dotenv library streamlines the process of
reading and setting these environment variables, offering a well-organized and secure approach to managing configuration
parameters in the user's Python projects.
