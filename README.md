## Thread Workers
Threading in programming refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. It is a
powerful technique that can significantly improve the efficiency and speed of a program by allowing multiple tasks to be
performed simultaneously.

## Logging
Consolidating logging within a single class offers notable benefits for code organization and maintainability. By
encapsulating logging logic in one dedicated class, the codebase becomes more modular and adheres to the principles of
encapsulation, isolating the logging concerns from the rest of the application. This approach ensures consistency in log
formats, handlers, and levels throughout the entire project, simplifying debugging and log analysis.

## NLP
Python's rich ecosystem, combined with open-source contributions and active community support, continues
to drive advancements in NLP applications, making it a go-to language for researchers, data scientists, and developers
working in natural language understanding and generation.

## ENV VARS
Through the use of the dotenv module, we ensure
that these environment variables are seamlessly loaded into the application's runtime environment. This not only
bolsters security by isolating confidential information from the codebase but also facilitates effortless configuration
adjustments without modifying the source code directly. The integration of the dotenv library streamlines the process of
reading and setting these environment variables, offering a well-organized and secure approach to managing configuration
parameters in the user's Python projects.
